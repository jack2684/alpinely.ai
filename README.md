### Understanding DRM Removal Risks 

Based on the search results, telling people about DRM removal tools is generally not considered illegal, but there are some important nuances to be aware of:

1. Providing information about DRM removal tools is typically protected as free speech. A U.S. judge ruled that it's not illegal to tell people about software that can strip DRM off e-books, as long as there's no intention to encourage copyright infringement[2].

2. However, actually creating or distributing tools specifically designed to circumvent DRM may be illegal in some jurisdictions under laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the U.S. or similar laws in other countries[1][3].

3. The legality of using DRM removal tools for personal use is somewhat of a gray area. In the U.S., removing DRM is often considered illegal under the DMCA, even for personal use. However, there are ongoing debates about fair use and format-shifting exceptions[1][3].

4. Laws can vary by country. For example, in the UK and Europe, removing DRM may be legal if done for legal reasons, such as to enable interoperability with other software[5].

5. While informing people about DRM removal tools isn't generally illegal, it's important to avoid actively encouraging copyright infringement or piracy[2].

In summary, while telling people about DRM removal tools is generally protected speech, it's advisable to be cautious about how the information is presented and to avoid promoting any illegal activities.
